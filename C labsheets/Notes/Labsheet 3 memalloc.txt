In this labsheet, you will work with structs in C. These are
exercises that you have worked out in C++. However, the
passing of reference parameters in C is different.
For any function that needs to perform input on a struct or
modify an attribute in a struct, use reference parameters.

<stdlib.h>
<string.h>

Modify the program in question 2 so that it uses an array of pointers to struct.
Note: In C, we use malloc() to allocate memory and free() to release the
memory.

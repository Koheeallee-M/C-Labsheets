Labsheet 1

The first labsheet will help you get acquainted with the C programming language and the
Linux environment. You will essentially need to get yourself acquainted with the
following in C programming language:
 Performing Inputs and Outputs.
 Using conditional statements.
 Using loops
Input/Output in C are different from C++. However, conditional statements and
loops are essentially the same.
In case the one lab session is not sufficient, you are advised to dedicate some of
your own free time to get acquainted with the essential programming constructs
in the C programming language.
1. Login onto Linux.
2. Create a directory for your lab works.
3. Open a text editor. Write the required C-codes that allow you to display the
message “Hello World” on the screen. Save the file as OS12016.c
4. Compile and run the program (This will be explained in the lab)
Henceforth for all programs, in CSE 2022Y, it is understood that the programs
will be written in C, compiled and run.

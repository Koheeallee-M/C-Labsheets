Labsheet 2
In this labsheet, you will work with functions and arrays in C. For all
programs requiring you to write functions, your program should also
contain required codes to test the functions.
Note: Reference Parameters in C is through the use of pointers.

Note: All Programs must be written in C.

Note: To use the math library, you have to use #include <math.h> in your programs and
for compilation you have to use
gcc <program name> -lm –o <object file>
Eg. gcc prog1.c -lm –o prog1
